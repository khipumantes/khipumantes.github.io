In this context, we choose to position ourselves as the heirs of a millennial tradition where the prefix "Neo" is what marks a division that is, in practice, more linked to the cultural milieu than to a temporal framework: as we resignify these artifacts of pre-Columbian origin within the Modern and Contemporary arts, we highlight its long history that goes beyond archaeological remnants. </p>

Yet, confronting current problematics that now make obvious the marginalization and mistreatment of our brothers and sisters, the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, we now make explicit our commitment on placing these interests and needs above, in case we come from urban or more Westernized areas. </p>

Therefore, we will maintain a critical position even of our own cultural and intellectual practice, always consulting the people that still maintain the traditions to which we refer to. </p>

We not place ourselves above Andean peoples, on the contrary: while some embrace their indigenous origins, some have more integrational stances and are interested in apprehending while becoming allies of Indigenous peoples, now defining ourselves in between these two worlds, taking advantage of our condition of intercultural medium to re-structure a hierarchy where the higher levels have been conformed by human groups of European heritage that dominated in a scheme where their arts and sciences are taken the most advanced since now South American lands were invaded. Thus, in the new hierarchy proposal that we put forward, it is this Pan-Andean Thought System of pre-Columbian origin takes the leading role when we talk about the South American region in particular. Although we dream with a non-hierarchical human society, we consider that this new framework is imperative as original populations of South America have been silenced and kept away from being part of social and scientific rethinking, so it is of extreme importance to allow these groups to guide the path towards the Future of Humankind. Our ancestors characterized precisely by developing civilizations, architectures and scientific techniques that took as starting point the harmonic relationship with the Natural World, knowledge that groups inhabiting the Andean area currently maintain;  the notion of ecological equilibrium as base for survival that leads to live together with the land they inhabited, not over it. As we know, this awareness is supreme knowledge now. It is advanced though, while being elemental. Our position is neither an inclination for "primitivism" nor a "good savage" ideation: these thought systems are complex as they imply an integration in between aesthetics, informatics and ecology.</p>

It is worth noting that this method of data storage is characterized by its tactility, bringing us to the body, to an experience that we share with the rest of humanity: thanks to touch we recognize ourselves in an intimate and personal way. Rubbing, pulling, stretching, caressing and knotting are concepts that go beyond what is commonly used when it comes to the design of human-computer interfaces, for example: by the devices developed by the Technokhipukamayoqs, inspired by the textile instrument, the same discipline, that of design of interfaces, is being reformulated.

However, it is seldom recognized that this same Western knowledge has been formed thanks to external input and appropiation, which seems to be a type of endemic practice of epistemic extractivism, einforced to this day: that is why our Khipumancer ideal is to rethink this history of Arts and Sciences so to finally place all branches of human development in the same hierarchy, where the inversion of the orders of power referred before would be the first step.

            <p class="mb-0">And it is for this future to be achievable that we consider that another technological narrative from the arts is imperative, one that will begin with the study of divergent technological expressions of the past and present. This history of the technique, written mostly by The Academy and treated as linear and unique, always ends up presenting any other technical knowledge system as primitive, as an ancient remnant or as a curiosity: the hegemonic Technoculture only sees in the European Enlightenment the great awakening of the episteme and this ends as the main path to validate its position in the world´s cultural hierarchy. Therefore, we highlight that the Neokhipukamayoq movement was born, is made, and is now defined from South America, recognizing that it has spread beyond its borders, already counting on representatives of non-South American origins closer to the hegemonic cultural centers, those who of course are welcomed with open arms as long as they recognize what is being proposed with in this Manifesto.

Nevertheless, we consider that, when referring to the Khipu in any research or work, it is necessary take into account the points included in this Manifesto, avoiding presenting the Khipu as an instrument of the past only, considering it as part of living traditions of the Andean peoples, always recognizing their origin in the Contemporary South American Arts one hundred years ago at the date of writing this Manifesto.
